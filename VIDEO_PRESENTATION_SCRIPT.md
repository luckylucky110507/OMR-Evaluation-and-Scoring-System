## 🎬 Detailed Script

### **Opening (0:00 - 0:30)**
"Hello everyone! I'm excited to present our Automated OMR Evaluation & Scoring System, a comprehensive solution that transforms manual OMR processing into an efficient, accurate, and scalable automated system."

### **Problem Statement (0:30 - 2:30)**
"At Innomatics Research Labs, we face a significant challenge: processing thousands of OMR sheets manually for placement readiness assessments. This manual process is:
- **Time-consuming**: Taking days to release results
- **Error-prone**: Human miscounts and mistakes
- **Resource-intensive**: Requiring multiple evaluators

With 3000+ sheets processed on a single exam day, we needed a solution that could:
- Achieve <0.5% error tolerance
- Process sheets in minutes, not days
- Handle multiple sheet versions
- Provide real-time analytics and reporting"

### **System Overview (2:30 - 5:30)**
"Let me show you our solution. [Switch to web interface]

Our system consists of three main components:

### **Live Demonstration (12:30 - 22:30)**
"Now let's see the system in action:

**Sample OMR Sheet**: [Generate sample]
- I'll create a sample OMR sheet with 20 questions
- The system will process it and show the results
- Notice the real-time processing status and confidence scores

**Real Upload**: [Upload actual image]
- Let me upload an actual OMR sheet image
- Watch as the system preprocesses, detects bubbles, and evaluates answers
- See the detailed results with subject-wise breakdown

**Batch Processing**: [Batch upload]
- Here's how we handle multiple sheets at once
- The system processes them efficiently with progress tracking
- Results are aggregated and displayed with comprehensive analytics

**Analytics Dashboard**: [Show analytics]
- View score distributions and performance metrics
- Export results in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Real-time monitoring of processing status and success rates"

### **Performance & Results (22:30 - 25:30)**
